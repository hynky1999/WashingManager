### Creating new user
The only way to create a new user is to generate a new user from the admin panel. The admin can create a new user by clicking on the "Create new account" button in the bottom left corner of the page in Manage section.

### Models Management
The admin can also create, edit and delete models. The admin can do this by clicking on the "Manage Models" button in the bottom left corner of the page in Admin Panel.

[!IMPORTANT]
It's bad idea to modify or touch the Borrow and Reservation models.
Since it can create a unconsitency in the database. Do this only if you know what you are doing.
